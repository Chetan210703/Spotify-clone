## Note for Contributors

To add albums to the clone, upload songs in a folder and place it in the `uploads` folder. Each album folder should contain:
- `cover.jpg`: Cover image for the album.
- `info.json`: Information about the album in JSON format. For example:
  ```json
  {
      "Title": "Chilling songs",
      "Description": "Listing Songs While Chilling"
  }
